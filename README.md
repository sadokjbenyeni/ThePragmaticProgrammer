- Buy low, sell high
- Review and rebalance

### Goals
- Learn at least on new language every year
- Read a technical book each quarter
- Read nontechnical books, too
- Take classes
- Participate in local user groups
- Experiment with different environments
- Stay current
- Get wired

### Duplication categories
1. Imposed Duplication
2. Inadverent Duplication
3. Impatient Duplication
4. Interdeveloper duplication

### Orthogonality
1. Keep your code decoupled (Law of Demeter)
2. Avoid global data                                 
3. Avoid similar functions

### Advantages of tracer code
1. Users get to see something working early
2. Developers build a structure to work in
3. You have an integration platform
4. You have something to demonstrate
5. You have a better feel for progress

### Debugging Strategies
1. Visualize the data
2. Tracing
3. Rubber ducking
